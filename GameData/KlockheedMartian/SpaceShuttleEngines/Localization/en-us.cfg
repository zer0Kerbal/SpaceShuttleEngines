		#SSE-tags = sse
		
		// Parts
			#SSE-engine-0-titl = FSX0 Micro Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-0-desc = Initially a toy model shuttle engine, this engine became successful as a leaf blower. Nice for engine clusters.

			#SSE-engine-0-oms-titl = FSX0-OMS Micro Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-0-oms-desc = Initially a shuttle engine. Now an OMS.


			#SSE-engine-1-a-titl = RX-25s Shuttle Main Engine
			#SSE-engine-1-a-desc = Looks like the real thang!

			#SSE-engine-1-s-titl = RX-25ss Straight Shuttle Main Engine
			#SSE-engine-1-s-desc = Looks like the real thang! Is not bent.

			#SSE-engine-2-titl = FSX2 Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-2-desc = A truck bumped into the engine. Now its bent. It is only good for shuttles with external fuel tanks now. It won't be good for orbital maneuvers without fuel tank. Use the OMS in addition. Warning! Can become quite hot.

			#SSE-engine-3-titl = FSX3 Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-3-desc = This is the PRO version of the X2. It is only good for shuttles with external fuel tanks now.

			#SSE-engine-4-titl = FSX4L Linear Aerospike
			#SSE-engine-4-desc = The epitome of kerbal rocket engineering. This wonder of technology can power shuttles of any color. Has an extreme gimbal range and is very efficient.

			#SSE-engine-bigbang-1-titl = Rotating Big Bang Engine I
			#SSE-engine-bigbang-1-desc = This was once intended to be a church bell. It turned out that it works just as well for rockets. It can rotate the nozzle. Try action groups for it.

			#SSE-engine-bigbang-2-titl = Rotating Big Bang Engine II
			#SSE-engine-bigbang-2-desc = This was once intended to be a church bell. It turned out that it works just as well for rockets. Unlike its brother, it cannot rotate the nozzle manually. It packs moaaar bang for the buck, though.

			#SSE-engine-oms-double-titl = Double Orbital Maneuvering System
			#SSE-engine-oms-double-desc = Twice the orbital maneuvering power for shuttles. Quite inefficient in the atmosphere. There are rumors that the orange box contains sandwiches for extended EVA activity.

			#SSE-engine-oms-single-titl = Orbital Maneuvering System
			#SSE-engine-oms-single-desc = Useful as orbital maneuvering system for shuttles. Quite inefficient in the atmosphere.

			#SSE-multiadaptatron-0-titl = Multi-Adaptatron S0
			#SSE-multiadaptatron-0-desc = A 0.625m engine mount to allow radial and other attachment. Put some below your tank and mount engines to get a multi engine mount.

			#SSE-multiadaptatron-1-titl = Multi-Adaptatron S1
			#SSE-multiadaptatron-1-desc = A 1.25m engine mount to allow radial and other attachment. Put some below your tank and mount engines to get a multi engine mount.

			#SSE-shoulder-1-titl = Radial Engine Mount
			#SSE-shoulder-1-desc = A high-tech piece made from old pineapple cans. Allows to mount additional orbital maneuvering engines to shuttles.

			#SSE-shoulder-small-0-titl = Radial Engine Mount for Dwarf Engines
			#SSE-shoulder-small-0-desc = A high-tech piece made from old corn cans. Allows to mount small shuttle engines.

			#SSE-shoulder-small-1-titl = Radial Engine Mount for 1m Engines
			#SSE-shoulder-small-1-desc = A high-tech piece made from scrap metal. Allows to mount 1m shuttle engines.

			#SSE_sparkler-titl = KM Sparkler
			#SSE_sparkler-desc = Launch effect. Hydrogen ignition system. Space shuttle launch sparks. Just for decoration.
			#SSE_sparkler-tags = launch effect ignition sparks shuttle hydrogen
